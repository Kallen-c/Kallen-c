### [Stake and BE BRAVE LIKE UKRAINE](https://forward-stake.com)

i'm Ukrainian and I love my country ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ I'm starting volunteer project called "Stake and BE BRAVE LIKE UKRAINE". I decided to create this project because I understand that we can help Ukrainian children who were left to live without parents because their parents were killed by russian military bastards!

The entire commission from delegated tokens is sent to help children who have suffered from russian aggression! Every Saturday I will withdraw commission and send it to charitable foundations, if you know those children who need help - write to me! I will send money to them!
