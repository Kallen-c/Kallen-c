Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

I am co-founder of [AMB](https://amb.place/) - the best solution for your ambassador program! 

I am Binance angel and former software engineer with focus on analytics. I have wide range of business, technical, and communication skills which have allowed me to manage complex crypto projects. I participate as validator/moderator/ambassador in mainnets and testnets of such networks as cosmos, polkadot, solana, as well as other unique blockchains. You can see a full list of what I am up to on [kallen.cc](https://kallen.cc/#portfolio).
