Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

I am a former software engineer with a focus on analytics. I have a wide range of business, technical, and communication skills which have allowed me to manage complex crypto projects. I participate as a validator/moderator/ambassador in mainnets and testnets of such networks as cosmos, polkadot, solana, as well as other unique blockchains. You can see a full list of what I am up to on [kallen.cc](https://kallen.cc). Also if you want earn some tokens stake with us [forward-stake.com](https://forward-stake.com). I would love to see you [here](https://forward-stake.com) ðŸ’•

We are a small community of experienced validators focused on high-quality and long-term cooperation with the crypto projects we are interested in. We cooperate with crypto projects starting from the testnet stage and continue to participate at the mainnet stage.

We trust only proven reliable hostings, our validators are equipped with the most modern data monitoring and analysis systems, as well as telegram bots. 
If you decide delegate on our validators, you can be sure that the risks are minimized, as well as get answers to your questions, more info in contacts section.
